Hello! Thanks for having a look at this, I'm really not doing too great.

- My main concern is file structure, as it's messing up my entire project, and makes every new (and old) function buggy. I tried adding a switch with the current structure, which didn't work. How can I restructure my files to make it functional? I'm afraid I'll get very lost if I try to copy Olivers structure this late.

- My second biggest concern is update and delete post functionality. I want to add a delete button and an update button for each post created by the user. I think I'll be able to figure out the rest, but tips are appreciated.

- Of less concern is the update profile functionality. I want the form to display when I click the "Edit profile" button, and disappear when I submit the changes. I thought I'd just create an eventlistener, but I'm unable to apply styles to both the form and the buttons.

- Which leads to my last question; how do I style the posts? I'm able to apply styles to the post, but not it's content.

if theres anything else I need to implement in order to pass, please let me know. I hope I make it in time
