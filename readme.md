Hello from the wrong side of deadline. I made a final attempt at completing this project, but I'm still missing edit and delete.

I realise this probably isn't enough, and that I'm likely to fail the course.

I wish I had more time. I spent a lot of time on a bootstrap error, and I'm required to work a lot leading up to christmas. I also wish I had seen Olivers video sooner, as my file structure has caused a lot of confusion and problems with routing. I really hate to give up, but I think it's time I accept my faith this time :P Gonna be a hard year with few breaks, due to this second resit, but I'll at least be more prepared next time :)
